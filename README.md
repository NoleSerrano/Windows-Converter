# Windows File Converter
This tool converts file formats to other files. For instance, converting .wav files to .mp3. You won't need any annoying online converters that not only take longer but also cap you on how many conversions you can do.

## Installation
- Install python and make sure the dependencies are installed.
- Install ffmpeg and and add it to the path
- Run the install.py **(with admin)** and this will update the registry files with the Convert command.

## Usage
After the installation, you can now right click on the files and click on the "Convert" option. A small GUI will pop up and you can convert it to whatever file you choose. There's a terminal behind the GUI that pops up and you can see if there's 
any errors that show up.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.6
- `pip install pydub moviepy Pillow`
- Download ffmpeg and add the path to the ffmpeg.exe file to your system's PATH environment variable

## Notes
Not all the formats have been added but do want to add them in the future.
